# Zhaoyi Zhou
## ABOUT
I am an undergraduate of Yao Class in IIIS, Tsinghua University (2020.9-present). 
I am interested in theoretical foundations of machine learning, including RL theory, game theory, DL theory, optimization and control.
## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND INTEREST
I am currently a remote member of the group of Prof. Adam Wierman at Caltech for summer visit. I am working on theory about MARL. To be specific, I consider policy evaluation of multiple agents under a network structure, which enables the reduction of a general globalized policy evaluation algorithm to a localized one. I prove a finite-time convergence of the localized policy evaluation algorithm, which we plan to apply to problems such as Markov potential game with other collaborators in our group.
Before that, I have been a member of the Machine Intelligence Group (MIG), led by Chongjie Zhang, assistant professor at IIIS, Tsinghua University. I worked on a project aiming at applying meta learning to multi-agent reinforcement learning.
